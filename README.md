# 100DaysOfCode

**Day 1:** Starting a new round of 100 Days of Code, with a lot of things to learn and to do. Today I just have configured a github hook between this repo and my twitter account using IFTT. In this way I'm going to automatically generate a tweet every time I commit in this repo :loud_sound: :rofl: 

**Day 2:** Today I have started with the AWS cloud practitioner certification. I have started with the first video course. 

**Day 3** Today I have continued watching videos for the AWS Cloud Practitioner certification.

**Day 4** Today I have continued with AWS Clous Practitioner Certification course.

**Day 5** Today I have been dealing with mail backup. I used offlineImap to create a local backup of my server because I'm closing our 1&1 server because we are not using it.

**Day 6** I have resumed the AWS cloud practitioner certification course :smile:
